# GPS and Maps iOS App

Welcome to the GPS and Maps iOS App, an application designed to utilize CoreLocation and MapKit frameworks to provide users with location-based services and mapping functionalities. This app allows users to track their trips, monitor their speed, distance traveled, and other trip-related statistics.

## Features

1. **Logo:** The application features a custom logo chosen by the developer.

2. **Start Trip Button:** Initiates the location manager to start providing the user's location.

3. **Stop Trip Button:** Stops the location manager from providing the user's location.

4. **Current Speed Display:** Shows the current speed of the driver during the trip.

5. **Max Speed Display:** Indicates the maximum speed reached by the driver since the start of the trip.

6. **Average Speed Display:** Calculates and displays the average speed of the driver since the start of the trip.

7. **Distance Traveled Display:** Tracks and displays the distance traveled by the driver since the start of the trip.

8. **Max Acceleration Display:** Determines and displays the maximum acceleration (absolute value) experienced by the driver since the start of the trip.

9. **Speed Limit Indicator:** The top bar turns red when the driver's speed exceeds 115 km/h.

11. **Bottom Bar Indicator:** The bottom bar turns green during the trip and gray otherwise.

12. **Consistent Units:** All measurements are displayed in consistent units: km/h for speed, km for distance, and m/s^2 for acceleration.

13. **Speed Limit Prediction:** Calculates the estimated distance the driver can travel before exceeding the speed limit of 115 km/h.

14. **Clean Code:** The codebase follows proper naming conventions, utilizes appropriate functions, classes, and structs to ensure readability and maintainability.

## Usage
